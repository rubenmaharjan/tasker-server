# Tasker Project

## The Backend

Vision Statement
For development teams who need to manage a projectâ€™s task schedule, Tasker is a Software as a Solution (SaaS) product that manages the scope, documents, change management, definition of done, task sequencing, and requirements for a project. The system shall be in real-time to enhance team collaboration. First, the project manager can define a project and its work breakdown structure of deliverables. Then, the project manager can add developers to the project, allowing them to complete the tasks in the task sequence diagram and mark their level of completion. The project manager can close deliverables and documents to stop the developers from making changes, requiring a change management request to be approved by the project manager for any changes after that point. Whenever a change is made or a task is completed, all developers assigned to the project will receive notifications of the changes. Unlike other project management software, our product, Tasker, shows a detailed view of the sequence of tasks to complete, how those tasks relate to one another and affect the schedule, and maintains version control on documents and deliverables.


## Current State

Tasker client side is currently under development. This software allows you to create, edit, archive and unarchive a "project". It also allows you to add a work breakdown structure and edit it.
